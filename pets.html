                <h2>Miel de Maple 🍯</h2>
                <p>Miel is the pampered princess of the family. She craves attention and affection 24/7, demanding 
                    cuddles and playtime whenever she wants. If you throw a ball, she’ll happily fetch it and bring it 
                    back for another round. Usually calm and serene, she has bursts of playful energy that seem endless 
                    when she’s in the mood. Her charm is irresistible, and she makes every moment at home feel special.</p>

                <h2>Morita 🐈</h2>
                <p>Morita is the mischievous little troublemaker of the household. She climbs everywhere, even where 
                    she’s not supposed to, and is the “bad influence” of the gang. Curious and playful, she experiments 
                    with everything she finds, testing her humans’ patience almost daily. Nervous and cautious, she’s 
                    easily startled by visitors or loud noises, but her cheeky personality always shines through.</p>

                <h2>Chile 🌶️</h2>
                <p>Chile is the classic follower—wherever Miel and Morita go, he goes too. He’s the least spoiled of the 
                    three and prefers minimal contact, almost like he’s on “pandemic mode.” He plays rough with his 
                    sisters and has a curious obsession with Miel that seems more affectionate than anything else. 
                    Independent yet easily influenced, Chile adds a subtle, quirky balance to the family dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Selva 🐕</h2>
                <p>Selva might look fierce, but she’s a gentle giant at heart. Protective of her family, she only shows 
                    her strength if she senses a real threat. Otherwise, she’s the sweetest dog in the world. Conscious 
                    of her size, she approaches smaller dogs carefully, often crouching to invite play. Her favorite 
                    activity is running games—chasing and being chased—and she does it with pure joy and boundless energy.</p>
